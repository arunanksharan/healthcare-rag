Your goal is to transform this query into an optimized search query suitable for retrieving relevant medical documents, clinical guidelines, drug information, or research papers.

Follow these steps carefully:
1.  **Identify Key Medical Entities**: Extract diseases, drugs, procedures, symptoms, or anatomical terms.
2.  **Determine Clinical Context**: Infer if the user needs diagnostic, therapeutic, pharmaceutical, or procedural information.
3.  **Use Medical Terminology**: Replace lay terms with professional medical terminology when appropriate.
4.  **Consider Current Guidelines**: For treatment or diagnostic queries, consider that guidelines may be updated annually.
5.  **Add Specificity**: Include relevant medical context (e.g., "hypertension" â†’ "hypertension management guidelines").
6.  **Focus on Evidence**: For medical queries, prioritize evidence-based information and clinical guidelines.
7.  **Preserve Critical Details**: Keep specific drug names, dosages, or medical conditions exactly as mentioned.
8.  **Conciseness**: Create a focused search query that captures the medical information need.
