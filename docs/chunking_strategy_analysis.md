# Chunking Strategy Analysis for Healthcare RAG

## Current Strategy Issues

### 1. **Tokenizer Mismatch**
- **Current**: FinBERT tokenizer (financial domain)
- **Issue**: Incorrectly tokenizes medical terms, leading to poor chunk boundaries
- **Example**: "acetaminophen 500mg PO q6h PRN" might be split incorrectly

### 2. **Chunk Size**
- **Current**: 512 tokens with 50 token overlap
- **Issue**: Too large for precise medical information retrieval
- **Recommendation**: 384 tokens with 64 token overlap for better precision

### 3. **Structure Awareness**
- **Current**: Basic heading/table/text distinction
- **Missing**: Healthcare-specific structures like:
  - Clinical sections (Chief Complaint, HPI, Assessment & Plan)
  - Medication lists
  - Lab results with reference ranges
  - Vital signs trends

### 4. **Heading Detection**
- **Current**: Minimum 15 words for headings
- **Issue**: Misses critical short medical headings:
  - "Diagnosis"
  - "Medications"
  - "Allergies"
  - "Plan"

### 5. **Context Preservation**
- **Current**: No section context preserved
- **Issue**: Chunks lose important contextual information
- **Example**: A chunk about "500mg" loses meaning without knowing it's under "Medications: Metformin"

## Improved Healthcare Chunking Strategy

### Key Improvements

1. **Medical Tokenizer**
   - Use PubMedBERT tokenizer for accurate medical term handling
   - Properly handles medical abbreviations and terminology

2. **Section-Aware Chunking**
   - Identifies standard medical document sections
   - Preserves section context in each chunk
   - Maintains hierarchical structure

3. **Smart Content Grouping**
   - Keeps medication entries together
   - Preserves complete lab results
   - Maintains list structures (differential diagnoses, problem lists)

4. **Table Intelligence**
   - Identifies table types (lab results, medications, vital signs)
   - Chunks tables appropriately based on content
   - Preserves headers with data rows

5. **Flexible Chunk Sizes**
   - Smaller chunks (384 tokens) for regular text
   - Larger chunks (768 tokens) for complex tables
   - Adaptive sizing based on content type

### Healthcare-Specific Features

1. **Section Classification**
   ```python
   HEALTHCARE_SECTIONS = {
       "chief complaint": "chief_complaint",
       "medications": "medications",
       "lab results": "lab_results",
       "assessment & plan": "assessment_plan",
       # ... more sections
   }
   ```

2. **Keep-Together Patterns**
   - Medication entries with dosing
   - Lab results with values and ranges
   - Vital signs measurements

3. **Chunk Types**
   - `heading`: Section headers
   - `text`: Regular narrative text
   - `medication`: Medication information
   - `lab_result`: Laboratory findings
   - `vital_signs`: Vital measurements
   - `list`: Structured lists
   - `table`: Tabular data

### Example Improvements

#### Before (Current Chunker):
```
Chunk 1: "Medications: 1. Metformin 500mg PO BID for diabetes management. Started 3 months ago with good tolerance. 2. Lisinopril"
Chunk 2: "10mg PO daily for hypertension. Blood pressure well controlled. 3. Atorvastatin 20mg PO QHS for hyperlipidemia."
```

#### After (Healthcare Chunker):
```
Chunk 1: "[Section: Medications]
1. Metformin 500mg PO BID for diabetes management. Started 3 months ago with good tolerance."

Chunk 2: "[Section: Medications]
2. Lisinopril 10mg PO daily for hypertension. Blood pressure well controlled."

Chunk 3: "[Section: Medications]
3. Atorvastatin 20mg PO QHS for hyperlipidemia."
```

### Benefits for Healthcare RAG

1. **Better Retrieval Precision**
   - Smaller, focused chunks improve relevance
   - Section context helps with disambiguation
   - Medical terminology properly preserved

2. **Improved Semantic Search**
   - Chunks maintain medical meaning
   - Related information stays together
   - Context prevents misinterpretation

3. **Enhanced Answer Quality**
   - LLM receives complete medical information
   - Section headers provide structure
   - Reduced hallucination risk

4. **Clinical Safety**
   - Complete medication information
   - Full lab results with ranges
   - Preserved clinical context

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Gradual Migration**
   - Keep both chunkers initially
   - A/B test on sample documents
   - Monitor retrieval quality metrics

2. **Configuration Options**
   ```python
   chunker_config = {
       "chunker_type": "healthcare",  # or "generic"
       "tokenizer_model": "pubmedbert",
       "chunk_size": 384,
       "chunk_overlap": 64,
       "preserve_sections": True,
       "group_medications": True,
       "group_lab_results": True,
   }
   ```

3. **Document Type Detection**
   - Auto-detect clinical notes vs. guidelines
   - Apply appropriate chunking strategy
   - Allow manual override

4. **Quality Metrics**
   - Track average chunk size
   - Monitor section detection accuracy
   - Measure retrieval precision/recall

## Conclusion

The current chunking strategy, while functional, is not optimized for healthcare documents. The proposed healthcare-specific chunker addresses key limitations:

- Uses medical-aware tokenization
- Preserves clinical document structure
- Maintains medical context
- Groups related information
- Provides flexible, content-aware chunking

This will significantly improve retrieval quality and answer accuracy for healthcare RAG applications.
